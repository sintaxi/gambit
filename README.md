# gambit
=============================

A minimal mobile UX navigation library.

## Why?

Mobile UI frameworks try to do too much and don't address the UX issues that actually make for a good user experience. They are too complex, too big, and focus on rich interfaces and superfluous animations instead of good UX and project maintainability.

## Principles of Good Mobile UX

These principles are my own, you may disagree with them and someone else probably has a better list somewhere and that is ok. This is my guide for how gambit should work.

1. Performance matters
2. Perceived performance matters more
3. Give as much feedback to the user as possible.
4. Transition contexts quickly and always before any expensive operations.
5. Show throbbers frequently.
6. Don't be afraid to omit transitions.

## Goals

1) Tiny
2) Zero Dependencies
3) Performant
4) Reasonable device/browser support (meaning: don't be stupid about it)

## Acknowledgement & Inspiration

This work draws inspiration from David Kaneda's JQTouch and TJ Holowaychuk's Express. It is the result of many discussions and experimental code written between Rob Ellis, Brian LeRoux and Myself. Thanks to all who have helped make the mobile web better.

Credit to Brian LeRoux for the name ;)
